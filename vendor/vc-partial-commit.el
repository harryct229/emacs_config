;;; vc-partial-commit.el -- commit only some changes from a diff

;; The idea is that after some happy hacking on a file, there are
;; several unrelated changes in our working copy. For instance, while
;; working on feature A, we hit bug B, so we corrected it before
;; continuing to work on A. But, we want to commit "atomic changes"
;; (e.g. only correction to B), so we want to commit only part of
;; thoses changes (as in "git add --patch"). So, we ask for the diff
;; between our working copy and the last updated file, we keep only
;; those hunks we want to keep (in diff-mode: k to delete the hunks we
;; don't want to commit now, for instance), and commit that. And then
;; we can make a second commit with the rest of the changes.
